# ðŸ“‹ Task Management Dashboard

A responsive, real-world Task Management Dashboard built with **React** and **TypeScript**. This project demonstrates component composition, form handling, filtering, sorting, local data persistence, and clean state management.

---

## âœ¨ Reflection
ðŸ“Œ React & TypeScript Implementation
This dashboard was initialized using Vite with the React + TypeScript template. All components were typed using custom interfaces (Task, TaskProps, etc.) defined in types/index.ts, ensuring strong type safety and clean prop validation. State was managed with Reactâ€™s useState and useEffect hooks.

## ðŸ§© Component Composition & State Management
Components were broken down and organized by responsibility:

- TaskList for rendering tasks

- TaskItem for task-level actions

- TaskForm for input and validation

- TaskFilter for sorting and filtering

- Dashboard for layout composition

## ðŸ§  Final Thoughts
This project gave me hands-on experience applying React and TypeScript in a real-world context. It strengthened my understanding of:

- Component composition

- Lifting and managing shared state

- Form control and validation

- Strong typing with interfaces

I'm confident this dashboard can be further extended with features like drag-and-drop reordering, backend integration, and user authentication.
